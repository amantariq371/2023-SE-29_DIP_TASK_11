Morphological Image Processing (Task 11)

This Python program demonstrates morphological operations on a user-uploaded binary or grayscale image. The program applies fundamental morphological techniques such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and boundary extraction. It also performs hole filling using reconstruction, noise removal, and shape detection by analyzing contours and classifying simple geometric shapes (triangles, rectangles, circles). All results, including the original image and processed images, are displayed side by side for easy visualization and comparison of different morphological effects.

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Google Colab files
